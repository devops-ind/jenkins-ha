1. Scope & Triggering

  - Should this update ALL teams' configs simultaneously or support per-team updates? It should have all/per-team update.
  - Should it be manual (operator runs playbook) or integrated with Jenkins jobs (Infrastructure/Config-Update job calls it)? Manual for now with future scope to integrated job.
  - Should it support environment-specific updates (update blue only, or green only, or both)? Both

  2. Configuration Source

  Where will the JCasC config files come from? Option A
  - Option A: Git repository (clone/pull and apply)
  - Option B: Jenkins DSL (generate from Job DSL, then apply)
  - Option C: Manual files (already on disk, validate and switch)
  - Option D: Templated from inventory (render templates from ansible/group_vars and apply)
  - Option E: Combination (template rendering + Git validation)?

  3. Update Strategy

  How should updates be applied? Blue-Green and Atomic Approach
  - In-place update: Modify current.yaml directly and trigger reload
  - Blue-green approach: Create new config version, validate, then switch 
  - Atomic operations: Backup before update, rollback on failure?

  4. Validation & Safety

  What validation should occur before/after update?
  - JCasC syntax validation? Before update
  - Jenkins connectivity check? Before and After
  - Config schema validation? Before Update
  - Test reload on a dry-run first? Before update
  - Automated rollback if post-update checks fail? After Update

  5. State Management

  Should the playbook track deployment state? Yes
  - Store which config version is active?
  - Maintain audit history (who changed what when)?
  - Version tracking (git tags, timestamps)?
  - Rollback to previous versions support?

  6. Integration Points

  How should this integrate with existing infrastructure? Standalone playbook, integrated with group variables
  - Standalone playbook in ansible/playbooks/?
  - Or integrated into existing site.yml with new tags?
  - Should it call existing roles or be self-contained?
  - How to trigger from Jenkins UI (call via ansible-playbook or use Ansible plugin)?

  7. Multi-Team & Idempotency : Idempotent

  - Per-team separate variables or batch operations?
  - Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)?
  - Detect if config already matches target and skip?

  8. Secrets Handling: Use Ansible Vault as already used.

  - Use Ansible Vault for sensitive JCasC values?
  - Reference vault values in templates?
  - Keep secrets in jenkins.yml or externalize?
