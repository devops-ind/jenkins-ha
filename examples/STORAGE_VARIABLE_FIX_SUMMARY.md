# Storage Variable Resolution Fix

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Error:** `'storage_path' is undefined` in `set_fact` task

```
Error while resolving value for 'storage_type': 'storage_path' is undefined
```

**Root Cause:** Attempting to reference `storage_path` in `storage_type` calculation within the same `set_fact` task before `storage_path` was fully resolved.

## Solution Applied 🔧

### Variable Dependency Issue
**Before (Problematic):**
```yaml
- name: Determine final storage configuration
  set_fact:
    storage_path: |-
      {%- if storage_preference == 'auto' -%}
        # ... complex logic ...
      {%- endif -%}
    
    storage_type: |-
      {%- if storage_path == shared_storage_path -%}  # ❌ storage_path not yet defined
        shared
      {%- else -%}
        backup
      {%- endif -%}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```yaml
- name: Determine final storage path
  set_fact:
    storage_path: |-
      {%- if storage_preference == 'auto' -%}
        # ... complex logic ...
      {%- endif -%}

- name: Determine storage type  
  set_fact:
    storage_type: "{{ 'shared' if storage_path == shared_storage_path else 'backup' }}"
```

### Key Changes

1. **Split set_fact Tasks** - Separated `storage_path` and `storage_type` into sequential tasks
2. **Simplified Logic** - Used simple conditional expression for `storage_type`
3. **Clear Dependencies** - `storage_type` now properly depends on previously set `storage_path`

## Logic Flow ✅

### 1. Storage Path Determination
```yaml
storage_path: 
  auto mode:
    - Check shared storage availability → use if available
    - Fallback to backup storage → use backup path
  shared mode:
    - Prefer shared storage → use if available  
    - Fallback to backup if enabled
  backup mode:
    - Always use backup storage path
```

### 2. Storage Type Classification
```yaml
storage_type:
  - "shared" if storage_path == shared_storage_path
  - "backup" otherwise
```

## Variables Required ✅

All variables are properly defined in `defaults/main.yml`:

```yaml
# Required for storage logic
shared_storage_enabled: false
shared_storage_path: "/opt/jenkins-shared"
backup_storage_enabled: true
backup_storage_path: "/var/data/jenkins-backup"
storage_preference: "auto"
storage_fallback_enabled: true
```

## Testing Verification ✅

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Variable resolution works correctly
- ✅ Storage path determined properly (`/var/data/jenkins-backup`)
- ✅ Storage type classified correctly (`backup`)
- ✅ No undefined variable errors
- ✅ Logic flow executes in proper sequence

## Benefits

1. **🔧 Fixed Ansible Execution** - No more undefined variable errors
2. **📋 Clear Task Separation** - Each task has single responsibility
3. **🔄 Proper Dependencies** - Variables defined in correct sequence
4. **🛡️ Robust Logic** - Handles all storage preference scenarios
5. **📊 Better Debugging** - Individual tasks can be examined separately

The storage integration now executes successfully with proper variable resolution and dependency management.
